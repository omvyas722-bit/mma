## CRITICAL: Groq API Key

The Groq API key (`GROQ_API_KEY`) is stored in `roar-mma/backend/.env`.
- NEVER remove it from `.env` or any `.env.*` file (except `.env.example`)
- NEVER hardcode it in any code file (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, etc.)
- If found hardcoded in code, remove it immediately and reference `process.env.GROQ_API_KEY` instead
- The `.env` file is gitignored; `.env.example` has a placeholder value

## Agent-Browser Test Backups

Two folders at repo root:
- `agent-browser tests backup/` — **original untouched backup** of all Playwright E2E tests. NEVER modify.
- `agent-browser tests/` — **working copy** cloned from backup. Free to modify on demand.

If you need to run or edit these tests, work from `roar-mma/frontend/e2e/` instead.

## Audit Findings (June 2026)

### Build Status
- `npx vite build` in frontend: **SUCCEEDS** — 67 chunks, no errors

### GAP_ANALYSIS.md Claims that are WRONG
1. "No audit log middleware" → FALSE. `backend/middleware/auditLog.js` exists, used in members/leads/classes/staff/transactions routes
2. "No webhook configuration in Settings" → FALSE. Settings.jsx has webhooks tab with `WebhooksSettings` component
3. "No 2FA setup/management in Settings" → FALSE. Settings.jsx lines 963-1011 implement 2FA enable/disable
4. "No Lightspeed manual sync trigger" → FALSE. Settings.jsx has sync button + `POST /api/webhooks/lightspeed/sync` route
5. "No barcode field on products" → FALSE. POS.jsx has keyboard buffer barcode scanning (lines 48-75)
6. "No revenue forecast section" → FALSE. Billing.jsx queries `/api/dashboard/revenue-forecast` and displays it
7. "No charts/graphs in frontend" (Reports) → FALSE. Reports.jsx uses Recharts: LineChart, PieChart, AreaChart
8. "No export to PDF" (Reports) → FALSE. Reports.jsx has `handlePrintPDF` using `window.print()`
9. "No conversion funnel visualization" → FALSE. Reports.jsx has funnel at lines 615-687
10. "Stripe has no customer-facing payment UI" → FALSE. Billing.jsx lines 503-526: full Stripe modal with StripeWrapper + StripePaymentForm
11. "No coach performance dashboard" → FALSE. Staff.jsx has performance metrics: classes_taught, avg_fill_rate, pt_sessions, pt_clients
12. "No win-back pipeline" → FALSE. Leads.jsx has win-back query + UI display
13. "Waitlist not implemented" → FALSE. Classes.jsx has waitlist count, roster filtering, visual indicators

<i>(all gaps closed)</i>

### Additional Verified Gaps (still open)
<i>(all gaps closed)</i>

### Gaps Closed by Prior Commits
- Certificate generation in Gradings (`CertificateModal`, `Gradings.jsx:315`)
- Fighter leaderboard (`FighterLeaderboard`, `Gradings.jsx:355`, leaderboard tab exists)
- Class level color coding (`TYPE_COLORS` in `Classes.jsx:16`, fill-based border coloring)
- Kids waiver auto-sign flow (`SEND_PARENT_WAIVER` event → messaging agent → pending signatures, Waivers.jsx with pending status + resend)
- Class fill heatmap (`Reports.jsx:512` — "Class Fill Heatmap — by Day of Week")
- Receipt printing (POS.jsx `ReceiptPreview` with email receipt + real transaction_id)
- Split-screen location view (`Classes.jsx:52` `splitView` state, side-by-side toggle button)
- Member CSV import (`Members.jsx` imports `MemberCSVImportModal`)
- Emergency contact in member profile (`MemberProfile.jsx:201` shows badge)
- Health declaration tracking (`DocumentsPanel.jsx:71`)
- Fighter competition result logging (`MemberProfile.jsx` competitions section)
- Bulk operations (backend `POST /api/members/bulk-delete`, `POST /api/members/bulk-update`, `POST /api/leads/bulk-update`; frontend Leads.jsx bulk selection mode)
- Unified notification system (migration `033_unified_notifications.sql`, `notificationService.js`, `routes/notifications.js` with preferences)
- Data retention policy UI (`Privacy.jsx` — RetentionPolicies tab)
- Data export request portal (`Privacy.jsx` — data export requests section)
- API key management UI (`Settings.jsx` — ApiKeysSettings component)
- Role permissions UI (`Settings.jsx` — RolePermissionsSettings component)
- Pixel tracking management UI (`Settings.jsx` — PixelTrackingSettings component, backend `GET /api/pixel/list`, `POST /api/pixel/create`)
- PerfectGym pages API wiring — added `GET /api/settings/locations` endpoint, fixed `PUT /api/settings` to persist, exposed custom keys at top level of settings response
- TikTok "Coming soon" removed — TikTok platforms now show Connect/Disconnect buttons
- Meta API live posting — verified already implemented (`metaApi.js` with `postToFacebook`/`postToInstagram`, publish route working)
- Class capacity override audit trail — verified already implemented (`classes.js:182` `auditLog('update_capacity', ...)`)
